# Lab 10 High-level Feedback
 * Great job! üëç Nice commenting!
 * You might consider making a Student class in the future to store info about
   each student, rather than keeping everything in one Scheduler class.
 * +2 extra credit: print schedule by student in alphabetical order. See code
   for note about first extension you attempted.
   (Note: 18/20 if no extra credit attempted.)
